Filler analyzer: Takes a TimeSeries object and returns a Float.

Zero-centres all the time-series and then calculates the variance over all 
data points.
    
Input:
TimeSeries DataType
    
Output: 
Float
    
This is a crude indicator of "excitability" or oscillation amplitude of the
models over the entire network.

    # type: dict(TimeSeries, float, int) -> float
    Compute the zero centered global variance of the time_series.

        Input time series for which the metric will be computed.

        Determines how many points of the TimeSeries will be discarded before computing the metric

        Divides the input time-series into discrete equally sized sequences and use the last segment to compute
        the metric. Only used when the start point is larger than the time-series length
