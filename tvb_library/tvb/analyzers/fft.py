    # type: (TimeSeries, float, function, bool) -> FourierSpectrum
    Calculate the FFT of time_series broken into segments of length
    segment_length and filtered by window_function.

    Parameters
    __________

    time_series : TimeSeries
    The TimeSeries to which the FFT is to be applied.

    segment_length : float
    The segment length determines the frequency resolution of the resulting power spectra -- longer
    windows produce finer frequency resolution

    window_function : str
    Windowing functions can be applied before the FFT is performed. Default is None, possibilities are: 'hamming';
    'bartlett';'blackman'; and 'hanning'. See, numpy.<function_name>.

    detrend : bool
    Default is True, False means no detrending is performed on the time series.
