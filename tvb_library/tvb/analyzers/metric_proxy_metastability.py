Filler analyzer: Takes a TimeSeries object and returns two Floats.


These metrics are described and used in:

Hellyer et al. The Control of Global Brain Dynamics: Opposing Actions
of Frontoparietal Control and Default Mode Networks on Attention. 
The Journal of Neuroscience, January 8, 2014,  34(2):451â€“ 461

Proxy of spatial coherence (V): 

Proxy metastability (M): the variability in spatial coherence of the signal
globally or locally (within a network) over time.

Proxy synchrony (S) : the reciprocal of mean spatial variance across time.

Subtract the mean time-series and compute.

TimeSeries DataType
    
Output: 
Float, Float
    
The two metrics given by this analyzers are a proxy for metastability and synchrony. 
The underlying dynamical model used in the article was the Kuramoto model.
