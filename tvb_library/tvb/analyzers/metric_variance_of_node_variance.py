Filler analyzer: Takes a TimeSeries object and returns a Float.

"""
Zero-centres all the time-series, calculates the variance for each node 
time-series and returns the variance of the node variances. 

Input:
TimeSeries DataType
    
Output: 
Float
    
This is a crude indicator of how different the "excitability" of the model is
from node to node.

    Compute the zero centered variance of node variances for the time_series.

    ----------
    params : a dictionary containing

        Input time series for which the metric will be computed.
