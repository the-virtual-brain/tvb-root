TVB RELEASE PROCEDURE

When creating a new TVB set of release packages you should:

	- update version number in: tvb_framework/tvb/config/settings.py BASE_VERSION
    - in case DB changes happened:
        * increment in tvb_library/tvb/basic/config/settings.py DB_CURRENT_VERSION
        * create a new DB update script in: tvb_framework/tvb/core/entities/model/db_update_scripts/
    - in case File Storage changes drastically:
        * increment in tvb_library/tvb/basic/config/settings.py DATA_VERSION
        * create the next update script in: tvb_framework/tvb/core/entities/file/file_update_scripts/
    - in case something changed in the code, which requires an update script:
        * create a new update script, with svn revision number in: tvb_framework/tvb/core/code_versions/code_update_scripts/
    - in case a Project structure changes :
        * increment in tvb_library/tvb/basic/config/settings.py PROJECT_VERSION
        * create a new project update script, with the new project version-number in: tvb_framework/tvb/core/project_versions/project_update_scripts/
            
    - refresh class diagrams:
    	* go in tvb_documentation/sim_doc and execute sh class_diagrams.sh
    	  	This will update images under tvb/simulator/doc/img. 
    	  	Commit the *.vsg that are used in the *.rst files on SVN.
    	* go in tvb_documentation/sim_doc and execute python generate_model_phase_plane_images.py
    		This will generate images used into Simulator documentation. PLEASE commit the used ones
    		on SVN, so they will be included in the final distribution.
    		To check, for missing images you can try to generate PDF for tvb.simulator.rst (with rst2pdf) and look for missing image errors.

    - run benchmarks for the new release:
        * run tvb.interfaces.command.benchmark.py and copy the resulted text from the console
        * manually create a file tvb_x.y.rst under tvb_documentation/doc_site/benchmarks
        * copy the output from console into this RST file and add headers where needed
        * edit tvb_documentation/doc_site/benchmarks/top_benchmarks.rst to point towards the new file in toctree
        * add the new x_label and values and run tvb_documentation/doc_site/benchmarks/generate_benchmark_img.py

    - check that all README files and manuals are still valid
    - fill new RELEASE_NOTES:
    	* if the release is an internal release add description only in ZWEI
    	* if the release is an official one, update also [tvb-root]/tvb_documentation/RELEASE_NOTES

    - run TVB unit tests (cd tvb_bin sh run_tests.sh) to make sure that everything is correct.
    - generate distribution packages with http://jenkins.codemart.ro/
        * when the release is public, copy the distribution files on [tvb-live-server]:/opt/tvb-public-releases/[version]
    - http://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei/cms#
        Upload new ZIPs with distributions under "Document" entity
        Create new entity TVB-Release with references towards the ZIP documents uploaded at the previous step.
    - TVB Documentation Site needs to be updated separately, by copying from Hudson the latest ZIP
        https://jenkins.codemart.ro/view/TVB/job/TVB%20-%20Build%20-%20Linux/
        Unzip and copy 	tvb-documentation-site.zip	at location /opt/tvb-documentation-site
        Check at http://docs.thevirtualbrain.com/

    - create release tag on GitHub also.

    - upload new packages on Pypi

    - make sure conda-forge packages are also released based on new Pypi packs
       
    - let the Force be with Us!
    
    
     
 TVB REST CLIENT release procedure:
    Usually, we need to:
        1. Release the tvb-rest-client package on Pypi:
            - it is mandatory to take the package from a Jenkins build
            - make sure you keep 'forever' that build and give it a significant name (eg: Release ​tvb-rest-client ​2.0.2)
            - download on your local machine the package from Jenkins
            - install it in a new environment and run the examples (eg: fire_simulation.py) to ensure it works correctly
            - upload it on Pypi

        2. Update the REST server docker image:
            - thevirtualbrain/tvb-run:latest - it is built and uploaded by Jenkins. We have to mount the proper
                                                 Keycloak configuration files inside the container.

    If there are changes in tvb-library that affect the tvb-rest-client, we need to release that, too.
    Make sure the version number is kept in sync for all of tvb-library, tvb-rest-client and tvb-framework.
