"""
The convention for adding a new update script is to just add a file starting with the
project version at which the script is updating data, followed by '_update_project.py'.

To make sure the latest script gets executed, we need to manually change in
tvb.basic.config.settings.VersionSettings.PROJECT_VERSION

The update script should have a module level function 'def update()' that does the actual
updates.

We intentionally break the Pyhon convention in file name (start with a number) to prevent
undesired behavior with direct import of these update scripts. They will be used by the manager, through introspection.
