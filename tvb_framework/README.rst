TVB FRAMEWORK
=============

The Virtual Brain framework is a complete framework including:

-  a plugable workflow manager;
-  a data persistence layer (with a relational DB and File Storage);
-  an HTML5 based user interface;
-  visualizers for neuro-science related entities.

The easiest way to make use of this code, is to obtain
a Distribution of TVB with Python and all the necessary packages linked,
and then clone this repo nearby. More details `in our
documentation <http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html>`__.

Alternatively, if you plan to develop long term with TVB, extensively
modify code, add new dependencies, or you simply prefer to use your own
Python installation, you may want to read this:
`here <http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html#the-unaided-setup>`__.

If you don't require the framework features listed above, the simulator
and associated scientific modules can be used independently; please see
the `tvb-library <https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-root/tree/master/tvb_library>`__
folder.

Framework structure
-------------------

::

    tvb-gdist
        |
        |
    tvb-library     tvb-data
          \          /
            \       /
            tvb.config
                |
                |
            tvb.core
                |
                |
            tvb.adapters
                |
                |
            tvb.config.init
                |
                |
            tvb.interfaces

**tvb-data** should be installed from **Zenodo**: https://zenodo.org/record/7574266/files/tvb_data.zip?download=1.
After download, unzip and execute `python setup.py develop` in the correct env.

Usage
-----

To use TVB code, clone from GitHub (https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-root), or get from Pypi::

    pip install tvb-framework
    python -m tvb.interfaces.web.run WEB_PROFILE tvb.config


Your port **8080** should be free, as a CherryPy service will try to run there.
Your default browser should automatically open http://localhost:8080/ which is the way to
interact with TVB Web Interface.

Testing
=======

For testing the package, the `Pytest  <https://docs.pytest.org/>`_
framework is used. Pytest can be installed using pip.

In addition to tvb-framework needed just for
launching the web, tests require few extra dependencies just for test (e.g. pytest-benchmark), which
need to be installed manually. The entire list of these dependencies for testing is found in `tvb_framework/setup.py`
under **extras_require**.

Pytest will run all files in the current directory and its subdirectories
of the form test_*.py or \*_test.py.
More generally, it follows `standard test discovery rules
<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html>`_

The command for running our tests has two forms.
Recommendation when working with a git clone of tvb-framework::

    cd [folder_where_tvb_framework_is]
    pytest tvb/test/framework [--profile=TEST_POSTGRES_PROFILE] [--junitxml=path]
    # default profile value is TEST_SQLITE_PROFILE

The second alternative form of running TVB tests, when installing TVB from Pypi, is::

    pip install -U tvb-framework
    pytest --pyargs tvb.tests.framework


Coverage
========

A coverage report can be generated with::

    pip install pytest-cov
    cd [folder_where_tvb_framework_is]
    py.test --cov=tvb tvb/tests/ --cov-branch --cov-report xml:[file_where_xml_will_be_generated]
