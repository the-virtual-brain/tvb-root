Attention!
Before running each deployment file into kubernetes, in order to select the namespace, you have to manually change
the keyword ${NAMESPACE} has to be replaced with the actual namespace name in 5 places in each deployment .yaml file.
After pod-db.yaml (pg-bouncer), pod-exec.yaml and pod-web.yaml are executed, in settings, Networking should be changed from "Do not create a service" to "ClusterIP"

landing-page.yaml
    -creates:
        - pod for tvb landing page

pod-web.yaml
    -creates:
        -pod for the web app

jupyter-lab-test.yaml
    -creates:
        -pod with a jupyter notebook
    - this deployment is used only for testing k8s libraries which need to be inside a pod when the code is executed

Attention!
The following yaml scripts should be executed in this order:

pod-db.yaml
    -creates:
        -pods for pg-bouncer and tvb-postgres


pod-assign.yaml
    -creates:
        -pod for operations-assigner


pod-exec.yaml
    -creates:
        -pod for process-operations
