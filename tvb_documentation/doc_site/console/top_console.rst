******************************************
Console Interface
******************************************

With TVB one can interact through 2 different interfaces: the web interface and the console interface.

While the web interface is easier to use, the console interface allows you to more freely do your actions,
not filtered by some UI mask. Obviously this comes with a small penalty, of a more difficult learning curve.

This chapter's purpose is to describe the Console Interface. To be able to work with the concepts from this
chapter, you are advised to first read chapter :ref:`top_basic`, for a detailed description of TVB concepts
and available actions.
