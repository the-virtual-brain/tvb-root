.. tvb_documentation documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Mon Nov 25 22:11:09 2013.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. IMPORTANT: Sphinx expects a non dummy toc tree in the index.rst
   This index page is not only the main documentation page.
   It is mostly the top level node of the document hierarchy
   Without this toc sphinx is lost, does not render navigations etc.
   The toctree is hidden, not rendered, it just defines structure

.. toctree::
    :hidden:

If you're familiar with Docker and/or Python environments, you can try early releases of the TVB software:


* We publish **Docker containers** on the `TVB DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/u/thevirtualbrain>`_.
* We publish **Python packages** on the `TVB PyPI profile <https://pypi.org/user/tvb/>`_

On CERN's data sharing platform *Zenodo*, we offer `various demonstration datasets <https://zenodo.org/record/10128131>`_, readily packaged for usage with The Virtual Brain software.

If you have specific questions, also about how to use TVB for your current research activity, you can use our `public discussion forum <https://groups.google.com/g/tvb-users>`_, which doubles as a *mailing list* if you prefer this channel.


In this forum, you can meet and discuss with other TVB users, as well as experts from our own support team. It's a perfect place to ask things like *"Does anyone else see that both the EEG and the BOLD have similar shape in terms of the 1/f type of drop off towards the higher frequency range?"*.
