"""
This module is called in a new process by the rpserver:
Example: python operation_async_launcher.py 4 user_name_label
4 is the operation id stored in the DataBase in the table "OPERATIONS"
It gets the algorithm, and the adapter with its parameters from database.
And finally launches the computation.
The results of the computation will be stored by the adapter itself.
