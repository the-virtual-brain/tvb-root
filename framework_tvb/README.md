# TVB FRAMEWORK

The Virtual Brain framework is a complete framework including:

- a plugable workflow manager;
- a data persistence layer (with a relational DB and File Storage);
- an HTML5 based user interface;
- visualizers for neuro-science related entities.

The easiest way to make use of the code from this Git repo is to obtain
a Distribution of TVB with Python and all the necessary packages linked, 
and then clone this repo nearby. More details [in our documentation](http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html).

Alternatively, if you plan to develop long term with TVB, extensively modify code,
add new dependencies, or you simply prefer to use your own Python installation, you may want to use the
[tvb-pack](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-pack) repo which gathers 
together several required modules and a few helpful TVB tools.
You will need in this case to setup your machine alone. Few guidelines can be found [here](http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html#the-unaided-setup).

If you don't require the framework features listed above, the simulator 
and associated scientific modules can be used independently; please see
the [tvb-library](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-library) repo.
