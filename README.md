# The Virtual Brain

"The Virtual Brain" Project (TVB Project) has the purpose of offering 
modern tools to the Neurosciences community, for computing, simulating
and analyzing functional and structural data of human brains, brains modeled 
at the level of the population of neurons.


1. To **install** TVB code on your machine, we recommend you first create a dedicated 
 Python env, and afterward to take our Pypi released packages:

        pip install tvb-library
        pip install tvb-framework
   
2. Alternatively and easier, you could simply download **TVB_Distribution** from:
<https://www.thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei/brainsimulator-software>. In this
variant, you will have Python, TVB, and all our 3rd party dependencies downloaded together, 
you do not need to do anything else other than unzip and double click on **tvb_start** command.

3. This repository holds the python sources for TVB main codebase. 
  If you clone this repository for extending its functionality, first create a dedicated Python 
  env, select it and then run inside **tvb_build** folder the following command to link 
  tvb-sources as libraries:
    
        sh install_full_tvb.sh


**NOTE:**

To contribute to this repo, you are advised to first fork it under GitHub (through the web UI), 
and next clone that forks on your machine, and use it as you use any other git repository.

More details on our documentation site: <http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org>.

   
### TVB Scientific library (tvb-library)

"TVB Scientific Library" is the most important scientific contribution
of TVB Project, but only a part of our code. 

"TVB Scientific Library" is a lightweight, stand-alone Python library
that contains all the needed packages to run simulations and
analyses on data without the need for the entire TVB Framework. This
implies that no storage will be provided so data from each session will
be lost on close. You need to either persist it yourself in some manner
or use the full TVBFramework where HDF5 / database storage is provided
as default.

   
### TVB Framework (tvb-framework)

The Virtual Brain framework is a complete framework, wrapped over tvb-library, 
and offering extra features:

-  a plug-able workflow and operations manager;
-  a data persistence layer (with a relational DB and H5 File Storage);
-  an HTML5 based user interface over CherryPy server;
-  visualizers for neuro-science-related entities.
 
You can launch the web interface of TVB with the following command:

    python -m tvb.interfaces.web.run WEB_PROFILE tvb.config
    
Your port **8080** should be free, as a CherryPy service will try to run there.
Your default browser should automatically open <http://localhost:8080/> which is the way to
interact with TVB Web Graphical Interface.

When using from sources (Pypi or Github, not TVB_Distribution), if you want BCT adapters 
enabled, you should manually download BCT <https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/>
and set env variable **BCT_PATH** towards the directory where you unzip BCT, plus also 
have Octave or Matlab installed with command line API enabled
    
### Testing

For testing our packages, the PyTest framework can be used. 

Pytest will run all files in the current directory and its subdirectories
of the form test_*.py or *_test.py.

The command for running our tests has two forms:

  1. Recommendation when working with a git clone of this TVB Github repo:
  
            cd [folder_where_tvb_framework_is]
            python -m pytest tvb/test/framework [--profile=TEST_POSTGRES_PROFILE] [--junitxml=path]
            # default profile value is TEST_SQLITE_PROFILE
    
            cd [folder_where_tvb_library_is]
            python -m pytest tvb/test/library [--junitxml=path]

  2. The second alternative form of running TVB tests, when installing TVB from Pypi, is:
        
            pip install -U tvb-framework
            python -m pytest --pyargs tvb.tests.framework
    
            pip install -U tvb-library
            python -m pytest --pyargs tvb.tests.library
    
- For all the tests to run correctly, the dependencies specified as LIBRARY_REQUIRED_EXTRA in [setup.py](https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-root/blob/master/scientific_library/setup.py) should be installed
- Make sure that the tvb-data package is installed from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4263723)

### Coverage

A coverage report can be generated with:

    pip install pytest-cov
    cd [folder_where_tvb_framework_is]
    py.test --cov=tvb tvb/tests/ --cov-branch --cov-report xml:[file_where_xml_will_be_generated]

    cd [folder_where_tvb_library_is]
    py.test --cov-config .coveragerc --cov=tvb tvb/tests/ --cov-branch --cov-report xml:[file_where_xml_will_be_generated]
