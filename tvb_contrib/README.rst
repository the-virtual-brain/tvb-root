THE VIRTUAL BRAIN CONTRIB LIBRARY
====================================

The Virtual Brain Project (TVB Project) has the purpose of offering some
modern tools to the Neurosciences community, for computing, simulating
and analyzing functional and structural data of human brains.

For more details, check: http://www.thevirtualbrain.org/

The current `tvb-contrib` is a package with TVB contributed additions to our simulator,
useful especially for scripting.

Use with::

    pip install -U tvb-contrib
