Description of the different test in the folder :

modify_wongwang_precision : test for compare the version in tvb and the modified version
update_function : test the function of function_tvb
proxy_precision : compare the result between simulation with one proxy and without proxy
proxy_precision_bad : it's the same test as previous but whit the wrong value at the beginning
proxy_precision_delay : compare the result between simulation with one proxy and without proxy and different delay
proxy_precision_delay_update : compare the result between simulation with 1-3 proxy and without proxy and different delay
proxy_precision_multiple : compare the result between simulation with 1-3 proxies and without proxy
double_proxy_precision_simple : test the transmission of information between two model with proxy in simple case
double_proxy_precision_complex : test the transmission of information between two model with proxy in most complex case
double_proxy_precision_complex_delay_update : test the transmission of information between two models with proxy in most complex case and different delay

function_tvb : function for run tvb more easily for the test
