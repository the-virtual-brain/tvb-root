modify_wongwang_2 : test for compare the version in tvb and the modified version
modify_wongwang_3 : test for compare the version in tvb and the modified version
update_function : test the function of function_tvb
proxy_precision : compare the result between simulation with one proxy and without proxy
wrong_value : it's the same test as previous but whit the wrong value at the beginning
proxy_precision_delay : compare the result between simulation with one proxy and without proxy and different delay
proxy_precision_multy : compare the result between simulation with 1-3 proxies and without proxy
double_proxy_precision_simple : test the transmission of information between two model with proxy in simple case
double_proxy_precision_simple : test the transmission of information between two model with proxy in most complex case

function_tvb : function for run tvb more easily for the test
